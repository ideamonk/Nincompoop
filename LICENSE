   Nincompoop is gift-ware. It is given to you freely as a gift. 
   You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way 
   you like, and you do not have to give the author anything in return.

   However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank the author 
   by making a return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing 
   an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to 
   the library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that
   other people can learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or
   make another game using it, it would be nice if you mentioned the author's 
   name an email address somewhere in the credits. We trust you not to abuse 
   our generosity.
